 A strongly polynomial algorithm for linear programs with at most two non-zero entries per row or column

  <p class="abstract">
We give a strongly polynomial algorithm for minimum cost generalized flow, and hence for optimizing any linear program with at most two non-zero entries per row, or at most two non-zero entries per column. Primal and dual feasibility were shown by Megiddo (SICOMP '83) and V&eacute;gh (MOR '17) respectively. Our result can be viewed as progress towards understanding whether all linear programs can be solved in strongly polynomial time, also referred to as Smale's 9th problem.
<p class="abstract">
Our approach is based on the recent primal-dual interior point method (IPM) due to Allamigeon, Dadush, Loho, Natura and V&eacute;gh (FOCS '22). The number of iterations needed by the IPM is bounded, up to a polynomial factor in the number of inequalities, by the straight line complexity of the central path. Roughly speaking, this is the minimum number of pieces of any piecewise linear curve that multiplicatively approximates the central path.
<p class="abstract">
As our main contribution, we show that the straight line complexity of any minimum cost generalized flow instance is polynomial in the number of arcs and vertices. By applying a reduction of Hochbaum (ORL '04), the same bound applies to any linear program with at most two non-zeros per column or per row.
To be able to run the IPM, one requires a suitable initial point. For this purpose, we develop a novel multistage approach, where each stage can be solved in strongly polynomial time given the result of the previous stage. Beyond this, substantial work is needed to ensure that the bit complexity of each iterate remains bounded during the execution of the algorithm. For this purpose, we show that one can maintain a representation of the iterates as a low complexity convex combination of vertices. Our approach is black-box and can be applied to any log-barrier path following method.

Approximating Competitive Equilibrium by Nash Welfare  </font>

  <p class="abstract">
We explore the relationship between two popular concepts on allocating divisible items: competitive equilibrium (CE) and allocations with maximum Nash welfare, i.e., allocations where the weighted geometric mean of the utilities is maximal. When agents have homogeneous concave utility functions, these two concepts coincide: the classical Eisenberg-Gale convex program that maximizes Nash welfare over feasible allocations yields a competitive equilibrium. However, these two concepts diverge for non-homogeneous utilities. From a computational perspective, maximizing Nash welfare amounts to solving a convex program for any concave utility functions, computing CE becomes PPAD-hard already for separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities.
<br>
We introduce the concept of Gale-substitute utility functions, an analogue of the weak gross substitutes (WGS) property for the so-called Gale demand system. For Gale-substitutes utilities, we show that any allocation maximizing Nash welfare provides an approximate-CE with surprisingly strong guarantees, where every agent gets at least half the maximum utility they can get at any CE, and is approximately envy-free. Gale-substitutes include examples of utilities where computing CE is PPAD hard: in particular, all separable concave utilities, and the previously studied non-separable class of Leontief-free utilities. We introduce a new, general class of utility functions called generalized network utilities based on the generalized flow model; this class includes SPLC and Leontief-free utilities. We show that all such utilities are Gale-substitutes.
Conversely, although some agents may get much higher utility at a Nash welfare maximizing allocation than at a CE, we show a price of anarchy type result: for general concave utilities, every CE achieves at least $(1/e)^{1/e}>0.69$ fraction of the maximum Nash welfare, and this factor is tight.

A First Order Method for Linear Programming Parameterized by Circuit Imbalance

  <p class="abstract">
Various first order approaches have been proposed in the literature to solve Linear Programming (LP) problems, recently leading to practically efficient solvers for large-scale LPs.
We introduce a first order approach for LP optimization with a convergence rate depending polynomially on the circuit imbalance measure, which is a geometric parameter of the constraint matrix, and depending logarithmically on the right hand side, capacity, and cost vectors. This provides much stronger convergence guarantees than the previous known methods. For example, if the constraint matrix is totally unimodular, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms. Our approach is based on a fast gradient method due to Necoara, Nesterov, and Glineur (Math. Prog. 2019); this algorithm is called repeatedly in a framework that gradually fixes variables to the boundary. This technique is based on a new approximate version of Tardos's method, that was used to obtain a strongly polynomial algorithm for combinatorial LPs (Oper. Res. 1986).

  <p class="abstract">
We consider ascending auctions for finding Walrasian equilibria in markets with indivisible items and gross substitutes valuation functions. Each price increase step in the auction algorithm requires finding an inclusion-wise minimal maximal overdemanded set at the current prices. This can be formulated as a submodular function minimization problem. We observe that minimizing this submodular function corresponds to a polymatroid sum problem, and using this viewpoint, we give a fast and simple push-relabel algorithm for finding the minimal maximal overdemanded set.

  <p class="abstract">
Optimal auction design is a fundamental problem in algorithmic game theory. This problem is notoriously difficult already in very simple settings. Recent work in differentiable economics showed that neural networks can efficiently learn known optimal auction mechanisms and discover interesting new ones. In an attempt to theoretically justify their empirical success, we focus on one of the first such networks, RochetNet, and a generalized version for affine maximizer auctions. We prove that they satisfy mode connectivity, i.e., locally optimal solutions are connected by a simple, piecewise linear path such that every solution on the path is almost as good as one of the two local optima. Mode connectivity has been recently investigated as an intriguing empirical and theoretically justifiable property of neural networks used for prediction problems. Our results give the first such analysis in the context of differentiable economics, where neural networks are used directly for solving non-convex optimization problems.

For any $\varepsilon>0$, we give a simple, deterministic $(6+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the Nash social welfare (NSW) problem under submodular valuations. 
We also consider the asymmetric variant of the problem, where the objective is to maximize the weighted geometric mean of agents' valuations, and give an $(\omega + 2 + \varepsilon) e$-approximation if the ratio between the largest weight and the average weight is at most $\omega$. 
<br>
We also show that the $1/2$-EFX envy-freeness property can be attained simultaneously with a constant-factor approximation. More precisely, we can find an allocation in polynomial time which is both $1/2$-EFX and a $(12+\varepsilon)$-approximation to the symmetric NSW problem under submodular valuations. The previous best approximation factor under $1/2$-EFX was linear in the number of agents.

  The correlation gap of a set function measures the ratio between two natural extensions. It has has been identified as the performance guarantee in a range of approximation algorithms and mechanism design settings. It is known that the correlation gap of a monotone submodular function is $1-1/e$, and this is tight even for simple matroid rank functions. 
<br>
We initiate a fine-grained study of correlation gaps of matroid rank functions. In particular, we present improved lower bounds on the correlation gap as parametrized by the rank and the girth of the matroid. We also show that the worst correlation gap of a weighted matroid rank function is achieved under uniform weights.

  <p class="abstract">
 We introduce a new polynomial-time path-following interior point method where the number of iterations also admits a combinatorial upper bound $O(2^nn^{1.5}\log n)$ for an $n$-variable linear program in standard form. This complements previous work by Allamigeon, Benchimol, Gaubert, and Joswig (SIAGA 2018) that exhibited a family of instances where any path-following method must take exponentially many iterations. 
 
The number of iterations of our algorithm is at most $O(n^{1.5}\log n)$ times the number of segments of any piecewise linear curve in the wide neighborhood of the central path. In particular, it matches the number of iterations of any path following interior point method up to this polynomial factor. The overall exponential upper bound derives from studying the `max central path', a piecewise-linear curve with the number of pieces bounded by the total length of 2n shadow vertex simplex paths.

We characterize a rich class of valuated matroids, called R-minor valuated matroids that includes the indicator functions of matroids, and is closed under operations such as taking minors, duality, and induction by network. We refute the refinement of a 2003 conjecture by Frank, exhibiting valuated matroids that are not R-minor. The family of counterexamples is based on sparse paving matroids. Valuated matroids are inherently related to gross substitute valuations in mathematical economics. By the same token we refute the Matroid Based Valuation Conjecture by Ostrovsky and Paes Leme (Theoretical Economics 2015) asserting that every gross substitute valuation arises from weighted matroid rank functions by repeated applications of merge and endowment operations. Our result also has implications in the context of Lorentzian polynomials: it reveals the limitations of known construction operations.

Approximating Equilibrium under Constrained Piecewise Linear Concave Utilities with Applications to Matching Markets

  <p class="abstract">
We study the equilibrium computation problem in the Fisher market model with constrained piecewise linear concave (PLC) utilities. This general class captures many well-studied special cases, including markets with PLC utilities, markets with satiation, and matching markets. For the special case of PLC utilities, although the problem is PPAD-hard, Devanur and Kannan (FOCS 2008) gave a polynomial-time algorithm when the number of items is constant. Our main result is a fixed parameter approximation scheme for computing an approximate equilibrium, where the parameters are the number of agents and the approximation accuracy. This provides an answer to an open question by Devanur and Kannan for PLC utilities, and gives a simpler and faster algorithm for matching markets as the one by Alaei, Jalaly and Tardos (EC 2017). 
The main technical idea is to work with the stronger concept of thrifty equilibria, and approximating the input utility functions by `robust' utilities that have favorable marginal properties. With some restrictions, the results also extend to the Arrow--Debreu exchange market model.

We present an $O(nm)$ algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths computations in a directed graph with $n$ nodes, $m$ arcs, and nonnegative integer arc costs. This matches the complexity bound attained by Thorup (1999) for the all-pairs problems in undirected graphs. Our main insight is that shortest paths problems with approximately balanced directed cost functions can be solved similarly to the undirected case. Our algorithm starts with an $O(m\sqrt{n}\log n)$ preprocessing step that finds a 3-min-balanced reduced cost function. Using these reduced costs, every shortest path query can be solved in $O(m)$ time using an adaptation of Thorup's component hierarchy method. The balancing result is of independent interest, and gives the best currently known approximate balancing algorithm for the problem.</p>

  We present a strongly polynomial algorithm for computing an equilibrium in Arrow-Debreu exchange markets with linear utilities. The main measure of progress is identifying a set of edges that must correspond to best bang-per-buck ratios in every equilibrium, called the revealed edge set. We use a variant of the combinatorial algorithm by Duan and Mehlhorn to identify a new revealed edge in a strongly polynomial number of iterations. Every time a new edge is found, we use a subroutine to identify an approximately best possible solution corresponding to the current revealed edge set. Finding the best solution can be reduced to solving a linear program. Even though we are unable to solve this LP in strongly polynomial time, we show that it can be approximated by a simpler LP with two variables per inequality that is solvable in strongly polynomial time.

<p class="abstract">
We give a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the asymmetric
  traveling salesman problem. Our approximation guarantee is analyzed
  with respect to the standard LP relaxation, and thus our result
  confirms the conjectured constant integrality gap of that
  relaxation.
  
Our techniques build upon the constant-factor approximation algorithm for the special case of node-weighted metrics. Specifically, we give a generic reduction to structured instances that resemble but are more general than those arising from node-weighted metrics. For those instances, we then solve Local-Connectivity ATSP, a problem known to be equivalent (in terms of constant-factor approximation) to the asymmetric traveling salesman problem.

<p class="abstract">
This paper investigates connections between discrete and continuous approaches for decomposable submodular function minimization. We provide improved running time estimates for the state-of-the-art continuous algorithms for the problem using combinatorial arguments. We also provide a systematic experimental comparison of the two types of methods, based on a clear distinction between level-0 and level-1 algorithms.

 Rescaling Algorithms for Linear Conic Feasibility

Partly based on IPCO 2016 paper.
</font>
<br>
<p class="abstract">
We propose simple polynomial-time algorithms for two linear conic
  feasibility problems. For a matrix A, the kernel problem requires a
  positive vector in the kernel of A, and the image problem requires a
  positive vector in the image of A<sup>T</sup>. Both algorithms iterate between
  simple first order steps and rescaling steps. These rescalings steps
  improve natural geometric potentials in the domain and image spaces,
  respectively. We also extend our algorithms for finding maximum support nonnegative vectors in the kernel of A and in the image of A<sup>T</sup>. The standard linear programming feasibility problem can be easily reduced to either maximum support problems, yielding polynomial-time algorithms for Linear Programming.

A Simpler and Faster Strongly Polynomial Algorithm for Generalized Flow Maximization</font>

  <p class="abstract">
  We present a new strongly polynomial algorithm for generalized flow
  maximization. The first strongly polynomial algorithm for this
  problem was given in [V&eacute;gh16]; our new algorithm is much
  simpler, and much faster. The complexity bound O((m+n log n)mnlog(n<sup>2</sup>/m)) improves on the previous estimate in [V&eacute;gh16] by almost a factor O(n<sup>2</sup>). Even for small numerical parameter values, our algorithm is essentially as fast as the best weakly polynomial algorithms. The key new technical idea is relaxing primal feasibility conditions. This allows us to work almost exclusively with integral flows, in contrast to all previous algorithms for the problem.

A strongly polynomial algorithm is given for the generalized flow
maximization problem. It uses a  new variant of the scaling technique,

The main measure of progress is that within a strongly polynomial number of steps, an arc can be identified

The rules of the games capture the structure of the linear programming relaxations. For linear costs we exhibit linear time best response dynamics that converge
